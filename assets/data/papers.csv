Slightly Relevant,"- Mutation-Agnostic Therapy: Restoring Cx43 expression effectively treats ACM across different genetic backgrounds, including DSP, PKP2, and DSG2 mutations.

- Effects: improve survival, rescue cardiac function, reduce arrhythmias, fix/stabilize structure.","- Therapy effects observed even when administered at late stages of the disease, showing potential for treating patients with existing structural damage.

- Evidence suggests Cx43 may act as a transcriptional co-factor, directly or indirectly upregulating the expression of mechanical junction genes at the RNA level.

- Longevity: AAV-mediated Cx43 gene therapy significantly prolonged lifespan in severe ACM mouse models, more than doubling survival time in some cases."
