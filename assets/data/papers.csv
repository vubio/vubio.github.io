Slightly Relevant,"- Mutation-Agnostic Therapy: Restoring Cx43 expression effectively treats ACM across different genetic backgrounds, including DSP, PKP2, and DSG2 mutations.

- Effects: improve survival, rescue cardiac function, reduce arrhythmias, fix/stabilize structure.","- Therapy effects observed even when administered at late stages of the disease, showing potential for treating patients with existing structural damage.

- Evidence suggests Cx43 may act as a transcriptional co-factor, directly or indirectly upregulating the expression of mechanical junction genes at the RNA level.

- Longevity: AAV-mediated Cx43 gene therapy significantly prolonged lifespan in severe ACM mouse models, more than doubling survival time in some cases."
1/31/2026 9:26:44,Mitochondria-Anchored Receptor Atg32 Mediates Degradation of Mitochondria via Selective Autophagy,2009,1/30/2026,Ongoing,"Autophagy, Mitophagy, Yoshinori Ohsumi, free GFP, JC",9,4. Crucial,"- Discovery of Atg32: Atg32 as a mitochondria-anchored protein that is essential for mitophagy.

- Selective vs. Bulk Autophagy: bulk autophagy is triggered by starvation, mitophagy occurs in post-log phase cells under respiratory conditions.

- Mechanism of Recruitment: Atg32 acts as a receptor by localizing to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacting with Atg8 and Atg11, which are critical proteins for recognizing cargo and initiating the autophagic machinery.

- Essential Genes: The research found that while 14 ""core"" Atg proteins are required for mitophagy, the process is mechanistically unique because it requires Atg11 but can occur independently of Atg13 (a core factor for bulk autophagy).","- Oxidative Stress Trigger: The expression of Atg32 is temporally upregulated during respiratory growth, and this induction can be suppressed by antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC), suggesting that OXIDATIVE STRESS helps trigger mitochondrial degradation.

- Selective vs. Bulk Autophagy: bulk autophagy is triggered by starvation, mitophagy occurs in post-log phase cells under respiratory conditions.

- Structural Specificity: Atg32 is a single-pass membrane protein with a specific orientation: its N-terminus faces the cytosol to recruit autophagic proteins, while its C-terminus stays inside the mitochondrial intermembrane space.

- Exclusive Cargo Sequestration: Using electron microscopy, the authors observed ""mitophagosomes""—double-membrane vesicles that exclusively sequester mitochondrial fragments while excluding other cytoplasmic components like ribosomes.

- Evolutionary Implications: Although Atg32 homologs were specifically found in yeast, it contains a conserved WXXI/L motif also found in mammalian autophagy receptors (like p62), suggesting a universal evolutionary mechanism for selective organelle degradation."
2/2/2026 11:00:12,Dynamics and diversity in autophagy mechanisms: lessons from yeast,2009,2/2/2026,Ongoing,"Autophagy, Mitophagy, Yoshinori Ohsumi, Review",7,4. Crucial,"- Identification of ""Core"" ATG Genes: Researchers have identified 15 ""core"" autophagy-related (Atg) genes in yeast that are essential for all types of autophagy. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and form the fundamental machinery for autophagosome membrane formation.

- Functional Subgroups: The core Atg proteins are organized into five distinct functional subgroups: the Atg1 kinase complex, the PtdIns 3-kinase complex, the Atg12 conjugation system, the Atg8 conjugation system, and a group of integral membrane proteins (including Atg9).

- The Pre-autophagosomal Structure (PAS): Most Atg proteins concentrate at a single perivacuolar site called the PAS. This structure serves as the assembly point where the core machinery is organized to initiate the formation of the autophagosome.

- Regulated Membrane Dynamics: Autophagy is not a static process; it is dynamically regulated by TORC1 signaling. In nutrient-rich conditions, TORC1 suppresses autophagy, but starvation or rapamycin treatment triggers the dephosphorylation of Atg13, which activates the Atg1 kinase and initiates PAS assembly.","- Great Cartoon differentiating Non-selective vs Selective autophagy.

- Non-selective vs. Selective: While starvation-induced autophagy is largely random (non-selective), ""conductor"" proteins like Atg11 allow the cell to specifically target damaged organelles, toxic protein aggregates, or invasive bacteria for degradation.

- Diverse Outcomes: Though the core machinery is the same, yeast can use these pathways for vastly different goals, such as the Cvt pathway, which is actually a biosynthetic transport route for vacuolar enzymes rather than a degradative one."
2/6/2026 13:31:37,HADHA Regulates Respiratory Complex Assembly and Couples FAO and OXPHOS,2024,2/6/2026,Ongoing,"Mitochondria, OXPHOS, SA, Yidong Bai",5,4. Crucial,"- HADHA as a Regulatory Factor: The study identifies HADHA (a subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, MTP) as a key regulator for the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) in mitochondria.

- Coupling of Metabolic Pathways: The research demonstrates a direct physical and functional link between fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), showing that these two major bioenergetic pathways are interdependent.

- Mechanism of Interaction: HADHA facilitates OXPHOS by binding directly to the membrane arm of complex I, which is essential for the stable formation of the respiratory chain.

- Impact of Deficiency: Reducing HADHA levels (through knockdown or knockout) leads to decreased supercomplex assembly, defective OXPHOS function, and the accumulation of lipid droplets, mimicking metabolic disease states.

- Pathological Significance: In mouse models, HADHA deficiency combined with a high-fat diet significantly worsens liver steatosis (fatty liver), highlighting how OXPHOS dysfunction contributes to primary FAO disorders.

","- Survival via Adaptation: The researchers used a unique cell line (4AR6) that managed to restore its respiratory function despite missing an ""essential"" mitochondrial DNA subunit (ND6), leading them to discover HADHA's compensatory role.

- Metabolic Stress Response: Cells naturally increase their expression of HADHA when forced to rely on mitochondria for energy (e.g., when glucose is replaced with galactose in cell culture).

- Reciprocal Defects: The study explains why patients with primary fatty acid oxidation deficiencies often suffer from secondary respiratory chain defects, and vice versa.

- Tissue-Specific Implications: The findings suggest that the coupling of these pathways may be more critical in high-energy organs like the liver, heart, and muscles, where FAO is a primary fuel source.

- Dietary Stress: The research shows that a high-fat diet acts as a ""stress test"" that can unmask underlying genetic vulnerabilities in mitochondrial proteins that might otherwise remain asymptomatic."
