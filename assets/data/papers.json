      "Essential Genes: The research found that while 14 \"core\" Atg proteins are required for mitophagy, the process is mechanistically unique because it requires Atg11 but can occur independently of Atg13 (a core factor for bulk autophagy)."

      "Identification of \"Core\" ATG Genes: Researchers have identified 15 \"core\" autophagy-related (Atg) genes in yeast that are essential for all types of autophagy. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and form the fundamental machinery for autophagosome membrane formation.",
      "Functional Subgroups: The core Atg proteins are organized into five distinct functional subgroups: the Atg1 kinase complex, the PtdIns 3-kinase complex, the Atg12 conjugation system, the Atg8 conjugation system, and a group of integral membrane proteins (including Atg9).",
      "The Pre-autophagosomal Structure (PAS): Most Atg proteins concentrate at a single perivacuolar site called the PAS. This structure serves as the assembly point where the core machinery is organized to initiate the formation of the autophagosome.",
      "Regulated Membrane Dynamics: Autophagy is not a static process; it is dynamically regulated by TORC1 signaling. In nutrient-rich conditions, TORC1 suppresses autophagy, but starvation or rapamycin treatment triggers the dephosphorylation of Atg13, which activates the Atg1 kinase and initiates PAS assembly."

      "Diverse Outcomes: Though the core machinery is the same, yeast can use these pathways for vastly different goals, such as the Cvt pathway, which is actually a biosynthetic transport route for vacuolar enzymes rather than a degradative one."
